A function that does not explicitly return value will in fact return `None`
In Python, `None` is a special constant that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is often used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value yet or to represent a default value in function arguments.

# key points
## Identity Check
use is to check if a variable is `None
## Defult Argument Values
`None` is often used as a default value for function arguments to indicate that no value was provided

## Initialzation
Variables can be initialized to `None` to indicate that they have not been assgined a meaningful value yet

# Common Mistakes
## Using`==` Instead of  `is`
beacuse `is` checks whether two objects are the same object, and`==` checks whether two objects are equal.   
And it differs from false and 0
